# Cross Product of Tables

When ever there are multiple tables in the FROM, the cross product of those table will be calculated and the any functions or WHERE clauses will be applied.

When you use GROUP BY in your SQL query, then each column in SELECT statement must be either present in GROUP BY clause or occur as parameter in an aggregated function.
